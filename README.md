<td>Hip ChicasTM is a multicultural multi-screened game franchise with five smart Latina characters who guide users in social and environmental missions to &quot;Help Improve the Planet&quot; [HIP] throughout Latin America and the US.<br/><br/>This Hispanic-themed franchise is designed to target &quot;post-Dora the Explorer&quot; older demographics. (Dora does $1BN annually with no cultural follow up in the market.)<br/><br/>Users are alerted to missions taking place in familiar places like Macchu Picchu, Tulum, Tikal, Easter Island, Chichen Itza, the Caribbean, Los Angeles, Miami and New York, while engaging the cultures, language and history at each location. <br/><br/>Each mission has multiple levels. Users can skip or speed up levels via in-app purchases. Users can activate friends to help them accomplish missions, providing a viral looping mechanism. They can make friends in multiple languages with canned chat translations for English, Spanish and Portuguese.<br/><br/>Hip Chicas fills a BIG need for culturally relevant content.</td>
